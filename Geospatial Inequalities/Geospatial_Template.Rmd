## **Introduction**

This reports highlights geospatial inequalities in COVID-19 transmission in the Local Authority of __`r pillar2_info_sub$LA_NAME[1]` (LAD: `r i`) __. Principally, bivariate maps and positivity rates broken into Quintiles will be used, and where possible data will be compared to regional __(`r pillar2_info_sub$RGN_NM[1]` - `r pillar2_info_sub$RGN_CD`)__ and National values. 

## **Data and Sources**

This report uses the [NHS Test and Trace Dataset (National Pathology Exchange Pillar 2 Data)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology).
The NHS Test and Trace System was launched on 28th May 2020 to help track the spread of COVID-19 in the UK. It contains both symptomatic and asymptomatic testing data from the National Pathology Exchange Pillar 2 database. This data has been made available via ONS Secure Research Service to identify flare ups of COVID-19 across the UK, and provide support to decision makers at local levels. __The NHS Test and Trace dataset contains `r pillar2_info_sub$total[1]` records from `r pillar2_info_sub$LA_NAME[1]`, spanning the time period of `r format(pillar2_info_sub$min_date[1],  "%B %d %Y")` to `r format(pillar2_info_sub$max_date[1],  "%B %d %Y")`.__

This report makes use of various measures to compare to COVID-19 Positivity Rates, all of which are claculated at Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) Geography, including: 

* [Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019). This is a composite measure of 7 domains of deprivation, with each LSOA given a decile 1-10. Decile 1 means the LSOA is within the top 10% most deprived in England. 
* [Population per Sq Km](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland). From the 2019 Mid-Year Population Estimates, which contains LSOA Population Density per Sq Km.
* [Overcrowding](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/qs412ew). Calculated from the 2011 Census Occupancy Ratings by LSOA. Overcrowding is calculated as a percentage- the number of bedrooms with occupancy ratings of +1 or +2 divided by the total number of bedrooms. 
* [Access to Healthcare](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/access-healthy-assets-hazards-ahah). Part of the CDRC Access to Healthy Assets & Hazards Dataset. LSOA Decile Ranking on Access to Healthcare, with a value of 10 indicating the LSOA is within the top 10% most deprived in terms of Healthcare Access. 
* [Internet User Classification](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/internet-user-classification#:~:text=%20%20%20%20Field%20%20%20,%20Interactive%20Map%20%20%20https%3A%2F%2Fmaps.cdrc.ac.uk%2F%23%2Fgeodemographic%20...%20). A CDRC Bespoke Classification at LSOA level, describing how residents interact with the Internet. e-Cultural Creators are daily users of the internet and are highly engaged, with e-Withdrawn the group with the lowest internet engagement.

This report will break data into the First Wave (January to 31st August 2020) and Second Wave (1st September to Present), with COVID-19 Positivity Rates calculated for both time periods. Data is presented at Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) Geography for the Local Authority. These individual geospatial measures and the COVID-19 positivity rates are then binned using the same breaks across the full pandemic into a 3x3 scale, allowing the maps for each wave of COVID-19 and geospatial measure to be compared to uncover changes both temporally and spatially. 

This work was produced using statistical data from ONS. The use of the ONS statistical data in this work does not imply the endorsement of the ONS in relation to the interpretation or analysis of the statistical data. This work uses research datasets which may not exactly reproduce National Statistics aggregates. Please note, that where categories are not presented this is because their values have been redacted to prevent data disclosure issues (i.e., counts < 10).

## **Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)**
The maps present Index of Multiple Deprivation by LSOA in the Local Authority, and Positivity Rates of COVID-19, for the First and Second Wave.
Index of Multiple Deprivation 1 is defined as LSOAs is within the 10% most deprived in England. For the bivariate maps the deprivation has been swapped (So 1 has become 10), so that a higher decile means a higher deprivation.

To interpret these maps: 

* Look at the IMD Decile map to provide context on deprivation (IMD 1 is most deprived).
* Look out for areas in the First Wave that are pink (high decile (IMD 1) and low positivity) that change to dark blue (high decile and high positivity).
* Look out for areas in the First Wave that are white (low decile (IMD 10) and low positivity) that change to turquoise (low decile and high positivity).

## **People per Sq Km**

The maps present People per Sq Km by LSOA in the Local Authority, and Positivity Rates of COVID-19, for the First and Second Wave.

To interpret these maps: 

* Look at the Population Density map by LSOA to provide context.
* Look out for areas in the First Wave that are pink (high population density and low positivity) that change to dark blue (high population density and high positivity).
* Look out for areas in the First Wave that are white (low population density and low positivity) that change to turquoise (low population density and high positivity). 

```{r FirstWave_popsqkm, echo=FALSE, fig.height=12, fig.width=12, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap=paste("Figure 3-COVID-19 Positivity Rate and Population per Sq Km, for both the First and Second Wave of the Pandemic.")}

```

## **Access to Healthcare**

The maps present Access to Healthcare by LSOA in the Local Authority, and Positivity Rates of COVID-19, for the First and Second Wave. A decile of 10 for Access to Healthcare is defined as the top 10% of LSOAs in England with the poorest healthcare access.

To interpret these maps: 

* Look at the Access to Healthcare map to provide context on Healthcare deprivation (10 is the most deprived).
* Look out for areas in the First Wave that are pink (high healthcare access and low positivity) that change to dark blue (high healthcare access and high positivity).
* Look out for areas in the First Wave that are white (low healthcare access and low positivity) that change to turquoise (low healthcare access and high positivity). 

```{r FirstWave_H,echo=FALSE, fig.height=12, fig.width=12, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap=paste("Figure 5-COVID-19 Positivity Rate and Access to Healthcare, for both the First and Second Wave of the Pandemic.")}

```

## **Overcrowding**

The maps present Overcrowding by LSOA in the Local Authority, and Positivity Rates of COVID-19, for the First and Second Wave. Disclaimer- Overcrowding was calculated using the [2011 Census Occupancy Rating](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/qs412ew), and as such is likely to be outdated.

To interpret these maps: 

* Look at the Overcrowding map by LSOA to provide context on Overcrowding.
* Look out for areas in the First Wave that are pink (high % Overcrowding and low positivity) that change to dark blue (high % Overcrowding and high positivity).
* Look out for areas in the First Wave that are white (low % Overcrowding and low positivity) that change to turquoise (low % Overcrowding and high positivity). 

```{r FirstWave_Over, echo=FALSE, fig.height=12, fig.width=12, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap=paste("Figure 7-COVID-19 Positivity Rate and Overcrowding, for both the First and Second Wave of the Pandemic.")}
# Plot Data

```{r national_Over, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=7, fig.width=12, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap=paste("Figure 8- COVID-19 Positivity by Week and Overcrowding Quintile.")}
# Plot Data 
plot_list[[i]][[8]]

```

## **Internet User Classification (IUC)**

The maps present Overcrowding by LSOA in the Local Authority, and Positivity Rates of COVID-19, for the First and Second Wave. Internet User Classification Value of 1 or 'e-Cultural Creators', with high internet engagement, and an Internet User Classification Value of 10 or 'e-Withdrawn', with low levels of internet usage and engagement.

To interpret these maps: 

* Look at the IUC map to provide context on Internet Engagement.
* Look out for areas in the First Wave that are pink (high digital exclusion and low positivity) that change to dark blue (high digital exclusion and high positivity).
* Look out for areas in the First Wave that are white (low digitial exclusion and low positivity) that change to turquoise (low digital exclusion and high positivity). 

```{r FirstWave_IUC, echo=FALSE, fig.height=12, fig.width=12, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap=paste("Figure 9-COVID-19 Positivity Rate and Internet User Classification, for both the First and Second Wave of the Pandemic.")}
