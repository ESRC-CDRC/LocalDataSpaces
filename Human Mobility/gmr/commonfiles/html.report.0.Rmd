# Google mobility report for `r ladatareport$lad19nm`
This report shows trends and changes in human mobility patterns for `r ladatareport$lad19nm`
during the COVID-19 pandemic in UK. Mobility patterns data is obtained from the [Google Mobility Reports](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) published by Google since April 2020.

## How to read the data
The Google Mobility reports contains data on people's movements collected by Google. The data is divided in six categories and reports the relative changes (%) in mobility patterns during the COVID-19 restrictions period compared to the **baselines** for each category in a period of time considered to be the  *normal* before the COVID-19 pandemic. The **baselines** are calculated as the median value for each category and day of the week from January 3rd 2020 to February 6th 2020. Since the data reported is normalized to a baseline, it is not possible to directly compare day to day to changes.
In addition, during weekends people do not work and tend to engage in recreational activities like going to a park or shopping, resulting in a change of the mobility patterns during the weekend, that are not caused by the tightening of restrictions. When interpreting the figures it is important to consider that variations are also be affected by local conditions, by holidays and even by the weather. For that, it is better to compare towns and regions that have similar characteristics (i.e. rural areas together).
Mobility data are collected from those users who turned the location history on -off by default- on their Google account.
The precision of the data depends on the user's phone settings and on connectivity. When the number of users in a category is not enough to maintain the user's privacy the report omits to include the change for the day for that category, leaving gaps in the data.
For additional information on the methodology, please visit the [Google Mobility Reports](https://support.google.com/covid19-mobility/answer/9824897?hl=en&ref_topic=9822927) help page.

## Retail and recreation
In this category are included places like restaurants, cafÃ©s, shopping centres, theme parks, museums, libraries and
cinemas. Relative changes in this category are negatively correlated with the restriction on movements imposed during the national lockdowns.
The line chart below show the trends in retail and recreation patterns for `r ladatareport$lad19nm`, while the area chart underneath reports the national trend for UK. The vertical lines delimit the relevant periods of the COVID-19 government regulations. In the chart, the shaded area shows the national trend for the same category.
```{r retrecr,echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Mobility trend for the retail and recreation category",out.width='100%',fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Retail and Recreation_line_area_uk.png")
```

## Grocery and pharmacy
The grocery and pharmacy category includes supermarkets, food warehouses, farmers markets, specialty food
shops and pharmacies. In the chart, the shaded area shows the national trend for the same category.
```{r grocpharm,echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Mobility trend for the groceries and pharmacies  category",out.width='100%',fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Grocery and Pharmacy_line_area_uk.png")
```
## Parks
Includes national parks, public beaches, marinas, dog parks, plazas, public gardens, national forests, castles, camp grounds and observation decks. In the chart, the shaded area shows the national trend for the same category.
```{r parks,echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Mobility trend for the parks  category",out.width='100%',fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Parks_line_area_uk.png")
```
## Transit stations  
In this category are reported movements around subway, bus, and train stations and other modes of transportation like	taxi stands, highway rest stops, car rental agencies and sea ports. In the chart, the shaded area shows the national trend for the same category.
```{r transitstations,echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Mobility trend for the transit stations  category",out.width='100%',fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Transit Stations_line_area_uk.png")
```
## Residential
This category includes, according to Google, places of residence. During the pandemic, people were advised to stay at home, work from home and limit their movements to the essential. The line chart below shows the impact of the *stay-at-home* advice from the government. Residential mobility is negatively correlated with workplace mobility.
In the chart, the shaded area shows the national trend for the same category.
```{r residential,echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Mobility trend for the residential  category",out.width='100%',fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Residential_line_area_uk.png")
```
## Workplaces
The pandemic and the lock down restrictions affected many businesses to the extent that the government had to intervene providing financial support to the furlough scheme and Universal credit. Mobility patterns in places of work generally decrease over all pandemic with negative peaks during the national lockdowns. In the chart, the shaded area shows the national trend for the same category.
```{r workplaces,echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Mobility trend for the workplaces  category",out.width='100%',fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Workplaces_line_area_uk.png")
```
## The new tier system and the third national lockdown

The following map display the evolution of activity restrictions for `r ladatareport$lad19nm` during the reintroduction of the Tier system in December 2020 leading to the third national lockdown announced on the 6th of January 2020.

```{r tiermap,echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Tier evolution leading to the third national lockdown",out.width='100%',fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0('img/',gsub(' ','',ladatareport$lad19nm),'_tier_evolution','.png'))
```

## Assessing the impact of the lockdown restrictions on human mobility in `r ladatareport$lad19nm`

During the pandemic the UK Government provided advice and implemented a series of regulations to limit the spread of COVID-19 among the population. The general advice was to stay at home and limit movements to the essential. On the 23rd of March, the first national lockdown came into place imposing severe limitation to human activities and businesses.

```{r covidchart,echo=FALSE,fig.cap="COVID-19 restrictions timeline",fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/covid19importantdates.png")
```

Following the first national lockdown, the restrictions were eased and the government promoted incentives to support businesses, like the *Eat out to Help out* scheme that started on the 3rd and ended on the 31st of August 2020. In December 2020 the tier system came in place for a the second time with the additional Tier 4, delimiting those local authorities with the tighter restrictions. The following charts show the median change from the baseline for each mobility category during the restriction period. The charts are in chronological order and
include the trends for the regional geography and for UK. The first chart reports the median values for the period 15th of February to the 23rd of March 2020 when the first national lockdown came into place.
